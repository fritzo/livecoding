WHITE PAPER:

- Pushing the overwriting approach to the limits.
  - Base class replacement. DONE.
  - Global variable replacement. DONE.
  - Combination of both. DONE.
  - Document for future reference. DONE.
- Unit test which demonstrates the local variable modification limitation. DONE.
- Unit tests which demonstrate the frame reloading limitation. DONE.
- Unit tests which demonstrate the immutable method limitation. DONE.

- Starting an update in place approach.
  - Single file update test.
    - Need a reload method which does update in place.
      The current code 'ReloadScriptFile' does the overwrite.
      No internals are currently exposed from the modules to allow update in place.
  - Different file base class update test.

- Comparison of the pros and cons of both approaches.

- Analysis of the limitations of 'reload'.
